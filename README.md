# Xss-vaildater
This is a Python script which is an automated XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) scanner that tests a given URL for vulnerabilities by injecting payloads and analyzing responses. It uses requests for HTTP requests and Selenium WebDriver to detect JavaScript execution via pop-up alerts.




`git clone https://github.com/Vamsi-29/Xss-vaildater.git`

`cd Xss-vaildater/ `

`chmod +x install.sh`                                                                       

`./install.sh`

`python3 xss-validater.py `
